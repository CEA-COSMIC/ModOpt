About
=====

ModOpt was developed as part of |link-to-cosmic|, a multi-disciplinary collaboration
between |link-to-neurospin|, experts in biomedical imaging, and |link-to-cosmostat|,
experts in astrophysical image processing. The package was
designed to provide the backend optimisation algorithms for
|link-to-pysap| :cite:`farrens:2020`, but also serves as a stand-alone library
of inverse problem solving tools. While PySAP aims to provide
application-specific tools for solving complex imaging problems, ModOpt can in
principle be applied to any linear inverse problem.
