About
=====

ModOpt was developed as part of |link-to-cosmic|, a multi-disciplinary collaboration
between expects in biomedical and astrophysical image processing. The package was
designed to provide the backend optimisation algorithms and tools
for |link-to-pysap| :cite:`farrens:2020`. While PySAP aims to provide
application-specific tools for solving complex imaging problems, ModOpt can in
principle be applied to any linear inverse problem.
